# Selenium introduction
###########################################################################################

# Selenium is a popular, open-source automation tool.
# Using Selenium, we can automate web applications.
# It was introduced in the year 2004 as an internal project by ThoughtWorks.
# Soon it became the market leader, among the different free and paid automation testing tools.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features and Advantages of Selenium:

# It is an open-source tool. It is free with no licensing fee.
# Selenium supports multiple browsers. Some of these are – Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, etc.
# It is platform-independent. It Can work seamlessly with all the popular platforms – Windows, Linux, Mac.
# It supports all the widely used programming languages. For example – Python, Java, Ruby, C#, JavaScript, etc.
# Out of which both Java and Python are widely used and have the major market share.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Selenium Components:

# Selenium IDE – It is a record and playback tool. Using this, we can quickly automate a simple workflow.
# But using this, we cannot create a full-fledged test automation suite.

# Selenium WebDriver – This is the most widely used component of Selenium.
# It interacts with the different browsers using browser drivers like – ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver,
# InternetExplorerDriver, etc.

# Selenium Grid – Selenium Grid is the Selenium component used to run Selenium tests,
# in parallel across different browsers and operating systems.

# There is one more component of Selenium – Selenium RC (Remote Control). But it is deprecated now.

# Why Selenium with Python?
# Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language.
# It is one of the fastest-growing programming languages in the world right now.

# Features and Advantages of Python:
# It is easy to learn and has fairly readable code. Due to this, it is easy to write and maintain Python code.
# The code written in Python is considered much faster, reliable as compared to other modern programming languages.
# It supports all the major platforms., and allows running the same code on different platforms without re-compilation.
# There are various open-source Python libraries and frameworks available.
# It also has a very active and large community support backed by companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.
# Python is an interpreted language that makes debugging of Python code very easy.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Selenium will support python and utilize selenium with testing: -
# It is an easy language as compared to another language.
# API empowers and connects with the browser through selenium.
# It sends the python command to browsers in their design.

# Use of python over java in selenium: -
# Java runs slow as compared to python programs.
# They use braces to start and end blocks while the python uses indentation.
# The java language employs a static type while python is a dynamic type.
# It is simpler than java.

#  We cannot automate standalone application.
